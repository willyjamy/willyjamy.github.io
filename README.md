I am going to create a joke chatbot that asks the user what word they want in their joke, then the machine will prompt out a joke, the user will have the option to continue or decide to stop at any point they want. I also want to create a seperate file where they can choose to save a joke they like, they also have the option to unsave.

I am goign to do codeacadmey higher level python courses and hopefully finish or do around 70% of the lessons, then, if needed, watch more youtube tutorials of implementing this chatbot to make my project less buggy

4/30/24-5/2/24, i am going to then create a draft of the new chatbot joke so I can figure out if there are any other bugs and how to fix them
 
5/3/24, i am going to create a second draft of this, making sure that every one of my code 

5/6, I just need to add any quality of life features on my project, to add and fix any bugs that I have on the replit. It will take a while for

5/7, I think that my project is almost ready for quality of live changes such as saving and unsaving, a joke, i did encounter little bugs such as multiple lines of jokes won't be saved properly when the user asks Replit to show all the list of jokes that are saved, there were some blank lines that are left empty even when there are no jokes left to save. I think this is a setup bug that can be easily fixed through 

5/13, It seems to be a very good stretch so far where I am trying to add more features to have a better playing experience with playing the game. I am  e

Week of 5/20:
5/20: Day 1, I've added a rating feature to the question where it allows users to rate the chatbot from 1-5, 1 being the worst, 5 being the best. Do know that when they rate it it doesn't tkae them out of the game, as they still can continue to play or type "no" to exit the game. In addition, for each certain rating, I've coded a response that asks why they gave the rating they chose. For example, if they chose 1(which is a terrible rating), I've coded a prompt that says ("Why didn't you like this game at all? Did you think the jokes weren't funny? Bland?). Thereon, for 2-4 I've coded a response (How could the jokebot enhance your playing experience in the future?). This asks for a user input else statement where they can type anything they wish for improvements and the system will automatically return ("Thanks for your constructive feedback, we will try to deliver high quality player experiences for you in the future!") I thought this was a great idea for players since it asks for their feedback so just in case I ran out of ideas the more people play the more new ideas
