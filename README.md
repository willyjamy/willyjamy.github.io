I am going to create a joke chatbot that asks the user what word they want in their joke, then the machine will prompt out a joke, the user will have the option to continue or decide to stop at any point they want. I also want to create a seperate file where they can choose to save a joke they like, they also have the option to unsave.

I am goign to do codeacadmey higher level python courses and hopefully finish or do around 70% of the lessons, then, if needed, watch more youtube tutorials of implementing this chatbot to make my project less buggy

4/30/24-5/2/24, i am going to then create a draft of the new chatbot joke so I can figure out if there are any other bugs and how to fix them

5/7, I think that my project is almost ready for quality of live changes such as saving and unsaving, a joke, i did encounter little bugs such as multiple lines of jokes won't be saved properly when the user asks Replit to show all the list of jokes that are saved, there were some blank lines that are left empty even when there are no jokes left to save. I think this is a setup bug that can be easily fixed through.


Week of 5/20:

5/20: Day 1, I've added a rating feature to the question where it allows users to rate the chatbot from 1-5, 1 being the worst, 5 being the best. Do know that when they rate it it doesn't tkae them out of the game, as they still can continue to play or type "no" to exit the game. In addition, for each certain rating, I've coded a response that asks why they gave the rating they chose. For example, if they chose 1(which is a terrible rating), I've coded a prompt that says ("Why didn't you like this game at all? Did you think the jokes weren't funny? Bland?). Thereon, for 2-4 I've coded a response (How could the jokebot enhance your playing experience in the future?). This asks for a user input else statement where they can type anything they wish for improvements and the system will automatically return ("Thanks for your constructive feedback, we will try to deliver high quality player experiences for you in the future!") I thought this was a great idea for players since it asks for their feedback so just in case I ran out of ideas, the more people who play the game, the more ideas I'll receive everyday. This idea came from a friend who played my game but couldn't understand the jokes so he wanted an option for his feedback. 

5/21: Day 2, Ascii art, yesterday I've finished the first part of my ascii art, the very first welcome page, it says "comedy chatbot" in 2 different ascii words, they are the right size so I didnt need to shape any of them. My goal for the rest of the project is to add ascii art for each different inputs the user creates. For example my first task completed yesterday, the rating feature, I have a star printed so it tells them to rate on a scale of 1-5. As of right now they can't rate a 0 yet. 

5/22: Day 3, NO SCHOOL

5/23: Day 4, NO CLASS

5/24: Day 5, In class today I will research more ideas for a small chatbot, listen to people's feedback who have tried it, my family, my classmates etc, pretty much they all like it so far. Some ideas I have finalized are "joke of the day" feature that would appear on the console when the user types "best joke". What this does is that it shows them which joke was the most liked(rated) for every joke that they ask. By the end of the day, I would see which joke got the most 5 star ratings & that is the "joke of the day". I will ask people who have played it how they think about it. 

5/28, Day 6: Today during class, I am trying to find new ideas for a chatbot to make it more engaging, what I mean by is I want users to have a better experience playing by implementing couple of quality of life features. I have came to the idea where I randomly select 1 specific hardest joke when most people couldn't answer & ask that joke to a user. If they can answer the question to the joke correctly, they will receive 5 points, they will have a max number of 5 points per day since I plan to only ask 1 joke per day they've never heard before and people who played this before said all the jokes were extremely ahrd to get the answer too and spent a lot of time thinking but ultimately gave up trying. So 5 points would definitely make it feel rewarding to them answering the hardest jokes correctly. The joke in the joke of the day will change daily, with that being said. Eventually it will be harder & harder to answer it correctly so I thought about instead of adding 5 points per day, I'll increase the number by 5 every day so the 2nd & 3rd day will be 10, 15, so on.
