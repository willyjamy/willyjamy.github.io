I am going to create a joke chatbot that asks the user what word they want in their joke, then the machine will prompt out a joke, the user will have the option to continue or decide to stop at any point they want. I also want to create a seperate file where they can choose to save a joke they like, they also have the option to unsave.

I am goign to do codeacadmey higher level python courses and hopefully finish or do around 70% of the lessons, then, if needed, watch more youtube tutorials of implementing this chatbot to make my project less buggy
